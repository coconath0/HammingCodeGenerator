# HammingCodeGenerator
This Hamming code generator is a final project for the course of Data Communication

This project is basically as the name says but the purpose of the project is that the Hamming code generated in PC1 will be transmitted via Bluetooth to another PC2

For the development of the project, 4 arduinos MEGA were used, 2 protoboards, 22 leds, 22 resistors, 1 package of male-to-male cables, 1 package of male to female and 2 HC-05 bluetooth modules.

As you can see below, we had to make an interface on guiEditor because one of the instructions was to use GNU Octave.

I was in charge of designing the interface of the generator and the code in guiEditor so that the hamming code can be generated by entering a 7-bit string. On the other hand, my colleagues Fabián and Arturo were in charge of making the Master and Slave circuit with the connections of the leds, resistors, arduinos MEGA, bluetooth HC-05 on the protoboard and configuring the bluetooth of the Slave circuit to PC2. Finally, my other colleague Milagros, was in charge of configuring the Master circuit bluetooth to PC1 and the codes in Arduino IDE to be able to communicate with each circuit Slave and Master.

The final result can be seen on the pictures below
